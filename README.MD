# Pac-Man in Space

### What is this game?
* This has a theme of traditional Pac-Man...but in space. The game plays similar to how the original in level 1, however, progressing to level 2 and 3 brings more enemies that increase the challenge.

### Who is the audience?
* This game is in the action genre, however, it lacks any sort of violence which is why the game is suitable for everyone

### Synopsis
* The theme of the game is Pac-Man, but the location is set in space. This is why in level 2 and 3 introduces meteors and lasers that are shot in set directions to increase the challenge.
* The goal of the game is to eat all the white dots (including the large powerup one). The levels are infinite in this game so there is no way to win. The real challenge is getting first place on the leaderboard to show off to all your friends who has the highest score.
* This game copies the original theme of Pac-Man but makes significant changes by introducing powerups (that can help or hinder a players progress), additional enemies (meteors and lasers).
* As well, to keep the difficulty from becoming ridicious really quick (espeically in level 3), the AI has been purposely dumbed down to make "wrong choices ie avoid trapping the player", however, it is still possible to die if you aren't careful. Around level 5 the AI will really punish you as the chance of it making a wrong choice becomes slim, which makes getting past level 5 a serious challenge.
